# it.each - Unit testing

## Application

The application is identical to `OneByOne` application.

## Architecture highlights

Same as on `OneByOne` application.

## Testing highlights

The only difference to `OneByOne` application is that test cases are gathered together inside a data table. For some developers this pattern is more readable. You can check it only on `SearchCriteria.helpers.test.ts` file.
